## About

This project was started to learn how to use [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for full stack development.

The goal of this web app is to allow users to get a list of new and popular songs of artists they follow from Spotify.  
It uses the Spotify Web API to search the Spotify database and to connect user's Spotify accounts to the app.
